# Introduce the wrapper

>⚙️ Make all the changes necessary to wrap the Kulinarisk in an [Adapter](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter).
> 
> You need to look at the code and the tests. And remember, you don't want slow tests!

> ⚠️ We are making changes without tests here. We are even modifying the tests. Ideally, we would need some end-2-end tests, with calls made from the external of our system to ensure we are not breaking anything. We don't have them here, so you'll need to be extra careful!

> ❓ Are the test passing now?
> Do you use the same vocabulary in the tests' code and in test names?

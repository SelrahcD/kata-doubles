The answer is 4: 2 in the Cuisinier class and 2 in the tests.

Let's be nice to our cook and fix the problem before starting the next serving. We will go back to the previous Kulinarisk version. This will be quicker than editing the code and all the tests.

> ⚙️ Run `composer require akei/kulinarisk:1.0` to roll back to the previous version of the Kulinarisk.

>❓After we upgraded to the new version our tests kept passing but the cook was unable to do its job. What happened ?

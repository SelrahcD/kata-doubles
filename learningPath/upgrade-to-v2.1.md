# Upgrade to V2.0.1

After a bug report AKEI noticed that the Kulinarisk V2.0 doesn't work as expected. They just published a new version of the library containing the fix.

> ⚙️ Get the new version of the Kulinarisk with the command `composer require akei/kulinarisk:2.0.1`

> ❓ Are the tests passing?

> ❓ Are you confident that we can deliver that new version of our software before the next serving?

# Using doubles

A solution you might have come with to make the tests run faster is to use doubles.

> ⚙️ Modify the test to use test doubles instead of calling the real and slow implementation of the Kulinarisk.
> 
> You can use PhpUnit mock framework, Prophecy or Mockery. They are already installed. Pick the one you're the most comfortable with.
